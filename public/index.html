			<h2>Cell Shader Implementation</h2>
			<p>For this project, I implemented a basic cell shader by applying a screen-space post-processing effect on the final frame-buffer before the image is rendered. The cell shader is inspired by the cel shading technique used in many popular video games such as <em>Borderlands</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>. This gives the Minecraft world a unique, stylized look that is different from the default look of the game. The shader works by dividing the pixel values into discrete ranges, which are then rendered as a flat color. Here is an example of what the cell shader looks like:</p>

			<h2>Wind Effect Implementation</h2>
			<p>Next, I implemented a very crude wind effect by writing a vertex shader that makes the leaf blocks sway. The wind effect is a common feature in many Minecraft shader packs and adds a sense of dynamism to the game. To achieve this effect, I applied an offset to the vertex position in world space before it is transformed to screen space. This offset is based on a time variable that is updated each frame, so the movement of the leaves appears to be random and natural. The wind effect is currently a work in progress, and I plan to refine it further to make it look more realistic. Here is an example of what the wind effect looks like:</p>

			<h2>Basic Diffuse Lighting System</h2>
			<p>Finally, I was able to get a basic diffuse lighting system working. The lighting of the face of each block is determined by the angle that face makes with the sun's direction. This makes the Minecraft world feel more dynamic and realistic. I accomplished this by writing a shader that computes the dot product between the normal of each face and the direction of the sun. This dot product value is then used to calculate the intensity of the lighting on the face. In addition to the sun, I also added support for ambient lighting and torches. The result is a basic diffuse lighting system that makes the Minecraft world look more immersive. Here is an example of what the basic diffuse lighting system looks like:</p>

		<p>Overall, I am happy with the progress I have made on my custom shader pack. I look forward to continuing to refine and improve upon these effects.</p>
